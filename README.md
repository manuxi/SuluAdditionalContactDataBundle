I made this bundle to have the possibility to manage additional properties in the contact.
Please feel comfortable submitting feature requests. 
This bundle is still in development. Use at own risk ü§ûüèª


## üë©üèª‚Äçüè≠ Installation
Install the package with:
```console
composer require manuxi/sulu-additional-contact-data-bundle
```
If you're *not* using Symfony Flex, you'll also
need to add the bundle in your `config/bundles.php` file:

```php
return [
    //...
    Manuxi\SuluAdditionalContactDataBundle\SuluAdditionalContactDataBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```
Please add the following to your `routes_admin.yaml`:
```yaml
SuluAdditionalContactDataBundle:
    resource: '@SuluAdditionalContactDataBundle/Resources/config/routes_admin.yml'
```
Last but not least the schema of the database needs to be updated.  

Some properties in co_contacts will be created.  

See the needed queries with
```
php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --dump-sql
```  
Update the schema by executing 
```
php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```  

Make sure you only process the bundles schema updates!
